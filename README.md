These files contain the different elements of my fourth year scripting project.

The validate.mp3 file will check your music folder for any mp3 file then scan it with mp3val.

The deps.py file installs the necessary dependencies to use mp3val and acoustid.

The twisted client server programs perform administrative actions on musicbrainz server.

The musicbrainz bash script installs the offline server.

pg_hba.conf and DBDefs.pm are preconfigured files necessary for the server.

Data dumps for the music brainz server can be downloaded from the following site .
